      <p>
       React, a stateful component is a component that holds some state. 
      Stateless components, by contrast, have no state. Note that both types of components can use props.
      </p>
      <h1>Example</h1>
      <p>
      in the example,
      there are two React components. The Store component is stateful and the Week component is stateless.
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default State
